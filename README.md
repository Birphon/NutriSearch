# Version Log

## Version 1
This was the initial concept. As debugging processes were happening the likeness of the project was rapidly falling and an uncertanty around it developed. This version was "archived".

## Version 2
A better plan was made during this version and was more functional than the previous however there became a lot of decision questions around this version and ultimatly it was found better to "archive" than to attempt to fix, fearful for "just plugging the gaps" fixes that will result into a larger failure later down the line

## Version 3
This is currently a work in progress. A lot more planning is going to start with this one.
