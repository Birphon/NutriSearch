# NutriSearch

NutriSearch is a prototype web application designed to help users in New Zealand search for food products and plan meals based on specific dietary and nutritional requirements. The goal is to make it easy for individuals with unique dietary needs—such as low sugar, gluten-free, or calorie-restricted diets—to find suitable food options and build meal plans accordingly.

## 🌱 Project Goals

- Build a user-friendly interface for filtering foods by detailed nutritional info.
- Allow users to generate custom meal plans based on selected dietary constraints.
- Develop a prototype to demonstrate to major New Zealand supermarkets for potential API partnerships.
- Integrate future support for real-time product data from:
  - Foodstuffs South Island
  - Foodstuffs North Island
  - Woolworths NZ (Countdown)

## 📍 Why New Zealand?

While there are many global solutions for nutrition tracking and meal planning, few are tailored to New Zealand's unique food market and available products. By aligning with local supermarkets and using real catalog data, NutriSearch can offer relevant, actionable insights for Kiwi consumers.

## 🤝 Future Vision

This prototype will be used to pitch to major supermarket brands for access to their product APIs. With official support, NutriSearch aims to scale into a public-facing web platform that empowers healthier food choices across New Zealand.
